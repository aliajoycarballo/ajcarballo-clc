                    <p id="paragraph1">The Philippines is one of the greatest countries in the world to be in. It boasts plenty of sites that
                        tell the story of the country, show the beauty of the archipelago and highlight the cultural diversity of the
                        people. It is home to many Filipinos, and many more non-Filipinos, that come 	
                        together to celebrate the astounding
                        increase of growth and development of the country. I, and perhaps others, as citizens of the country, find it very amusing how many people from many different places, far and near, are able to find joy, love and security in our very own “Lupang hinirang.” However, any country as magnificent as our 'very
                        own' is never unburdened by the problems of society. One issue that the Philippines is facing right now is Overpopulation, but how could it be solved?</p>
                        <p>Well, if there's a problem, there's always a solution. If overpopulation is caused by the continuous
                        advancements in the medical field for the past few decades, why don't we just stop, or at least delay, cure
                        research for various diseases. Take for example today's Coronavirus pandemic. As of October, almost
                            7,000 people have died from the novel disease. If it were to continue</p>

                            <quote>“ Starting from birth, infants are already burdened with the problem of overpopulation in the country. They are subjected to circumstances that no children their age deserve. ”</quote><br><br>
                        <p>without the presence of a cure, the
                        population will greatly reduce; and since its victims are mostly those of the older age group, the effect
                        would only be reflecting what could've happened in a shorter time. This solution not only easily solves
                        overpopulation by increasing disease-related deaths, but also gives the government a chance to transfer a
                        larger quantity of funds to other fields such as education. According to the key findings of the 2009 Asia
                        Development Bank book “Poverty in the Philippines,” poverty, a main factor of overpopulation, is linked to
                        educational attainment. If we were to give children, who otherwise had no chance to access proper
                        education because of certain causes, the opportunity to receive proper education, including proper Sex
                        Education, which the lack of also immensely causes overpopulation, we could start to pave the path in
                        overcoming poverty in the country.</p>
                        <p>Starting from birth, infants are already burdened with the problem of overpopulation in the country. They are subjected to circumstances 	that no children their age deserve.</p>

                        <p></p>
                        <p>If the people don't want the idea of reducing the population by stopping cure research, why not do
                        something more fun. Each city or province in the country could do a lottery to see which people get to live
                        another day. If each city or province were to hold this lottery every week, in the interest of not having to
                        possibly deal with the loss of someone close each day, the people would at least have the opportunity to
                        spend seven days with their loved ones before possibly being chosen for death, don't worry, it's for a
                        cause! If this suggestion was to be taken into consideration, I think that the weekly lottery should continue
                        until the Philippines is no longer considered overpopulated. In terms of the way of carnage, Carbon
                        monoxide or CO, which is pretty abundant, poisoning can be used. When CO builds up in a person's
                        bloodstream, their body replaces the oxygen in red blood cells with the aforementioned gas, this then leads
                        to serious tissue damage or death. According to research, high concentration of Carbon monoxide could
                        lead to death in less than five minutes. Yes, this solution is also a bit over the top but it could potentially
                        solve overpopulation in the country faster, which means a shorter time of weekly planned deaths.</p>
                        <p>In Jonathan Swift's 'A Modest Proposal,' he proposes that the children of poor families could be sold to those of the higher class to solve overpopulation in Ireland during his time.</p>
                        <p>Now, if you neither agree with the first nor the second, you could consider a new diet composing of
                        one-year-old infant carcasses as a substitute for animal meat. Yes, I meant cannibalism. This proposal was
                        from Jonathan Swift, an Irish satirist who also proposed different ways of using infant carcasses to solve
                        the burden brought to Ireland and the parents of poor children during the year 1729.</p>
                        <p>The Philippines is overpopulated. The problem is yet to reach its climax. If it does, no one would
                        know what happens to our country. What we do know is that it's coming. It's coming and we are given the
                        chance to stop it by taking matters into our own hands. Hesitating would only lead to more frustrations. If
                        we act on it now, it wouldn't be a problem later. So let us all work together to fix the problem that is brought
                        upon us.</p>
